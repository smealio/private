    "messageText": "When directed by state guidelines, and predicated on our ability to secure adequate vaccine supply to ensure availability for first and second doses, CTCA is planning to offer eligible patients the COVID-19 vaccine as part of their regularly scheduled appointments. If patients have received guidance from their physician and have access to receive the vaccine through local or state-directed avenues, we highly recommend they do so.  We are continuing to determine logistics to vaccinate patients at CTCA, and we will communicate if and when we can do so."

If you experience any symptoms you feel require immediate medical attention, you must report to the closest emergency services department or dial 911. We are taking this measure to ensure the safety and health of all our patients and their loved ones.\n"

    "messageText": "At this time, for general outpatient appointments, we are limiting caregivers to one per patient, and no one under the age of 18 will be permitted at any site, with special exceptions in some cases. However, all caregivers and visitors will not be permitted in certain areas of the hospital, such as highly sensitive inpatient units and pre-op areas, to protect the health and safety of our patients. Please talk to your care team about whether these measures will affect you, certain exceptions that may be made and steps weâ€™re taking to continue to keep your caregiver involved in your care."

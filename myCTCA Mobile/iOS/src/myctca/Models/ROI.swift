/**
 This object was declared as a struct to make it smaller and copyable instead of passing by reference.
    1. Encapsulates a few relatively simple data values.
    2. Reasonable to expect that the encapsulated values will be copied rather than referenced
    3. Properties stored by the struct are themselves value types
    4. The struct does not need to inherit properties or behavior from another existing type.
 Struct instances are allocated on stack, and class instances are allocated on heap so sructs are faster.
 
 Codable means that it can be directly encoded (for JSON, in this case)
